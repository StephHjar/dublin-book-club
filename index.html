                <p>The Dublin Book Club was founded in 2020, as a way to connect with fellow book lovers. Each meeting is hosted by a member of the club, who will come prepared with questions to ask, 
                    which prompt discussion about the book weâ€™ve read - and there is also plenty of time to socialize as well! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="about-right">
                <p>Book selections are generally adult fiction novels, with some genre fiction sprinkled in. At the end of each meeting, the host member will suggest 3 book options, and the rest of the 
                    group will vote on the next book. Curious? Check out some past events and hear from current members in our <a href="gallery.html">gallery!</a></p>
